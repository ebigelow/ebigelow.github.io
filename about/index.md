## About Me

My name is Eric Bigelow and I'm a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Rochester, located in balmy upstate New York.

I like thinking about brains, language, and all things A.I. These days, this is mostly focused around various topics in NLP, computer vision, and machine learning.  

I love juggling and poi, sometimes I play music, and once in a while I take photos (all the photos on this site are my own).

One day I'll write some blog posts.
