## Work Experience
<br>


#### University of Rochester, Brain & Cognitive Sciences Department



***Lab Manager***, **[Computation & Language Lab](https://colala.bcs.rochester.edu)** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *8/2014* - *8/2015* 

* Led project implementing vectorized data analysis to infer posterior distributions over hyper-parameters in a Bayesian model of concept learning

* Contributed to open-source Python library for statistical modeling

* Designed 600+ participant numerical cognition study, distributed over Amazon Mechanical Turk


***Research Assistant***, **Supervisor: [Mike Tanenhaus](https://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/mtan/mtan.html)**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *5/2012* - *11/2012* 

Worked with experimental paradigm studying grounding and miscommunication in dialogue during collaborative problem solving task




<br>


#### University of Rochester, Computer Science Department


***Research Assistant***, **[Rochester Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/hci/)**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *6/2015* - *8/2015* 



* Applied supervised and unsupervised algorithms to a large multimodal dataset (the MIT Interview Dataset, pending public release)

* Wrote Matlab code to perform time-series analysis, audio & video manipulation, data visualization, and for saving & loading data across functions in a common structured format


***Research Assistant***, **Supervisor: [Len Schubert](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~schubert/)**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *1/2013* - *5/2014* 

* Leading role in novel project to implement a specialist system for reasoning with spatial language as part of a larger natural language understanding framework; designed primary components of architecture

* Worked with two other undergraduates in an independently organized group to develop specialist architecture and model database using Python
